# DMolybTarget
### The project is a Monte-Carlo simulation of the solid cyclotron target consist of the Molybdenum-100 and Molybdenum-98 placed one by one on the path of 11-MeV proton beam. 
### The first stage of the investigation is to create a single-molybdenum target (SMT, or 100MT) and bombard it. The SMT material is the Molybdenum-100.
### The reaction type is $^{100}Mo(p, n)^{99m}Tc$. The goal is to study the Technetium-99 yield and activity.

1. Part 1 - water cooler
2. Part 2 - holder with target material
3. Part 2.1 - outer holder
4. Part 2.2 - locker with $^{100}Mo$ tablet
5. Part 2.3 - threaded nut

4 different solids: WaterCooler, OuterHolder, TabletLocker, ThreadedNut

Ooopss... I forgot about the target table itself, now 5 solids.
The MolybdenumTablet is also include

The experimental setup is an accelerator Siemens Eclipse RD 11-MeV Cyclotron
based at Feofaniya Clinical Hospital in Kyiv, Ukraine

### There will be a possible extension of this Geant4-based application for cyclotron solid target particle transport simulation for IBA Cyclone 18/9 accelerator;
